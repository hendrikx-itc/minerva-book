Introduction
============

The Minerva book describes how to setup and maintain Minerva instances. This
includes the PostgreSQL database part, but also populating the database using
the command line interface, Minerva Nodes and RabbitMQ, which provides the
nodes with jobs. We will start out with the basics and the more manual approach
and build up towards a continuous processing setup.

To follow the instructions in this book, it is assumed that you have access to
a Linux based operating system (e.g. Ubuntu), because that is what Minerva is
normally deployed on.
