KPIs
====

KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators are indicators for the quality of
functioning of a system, organization or something else. These indicators are
often calculated from some other raw data. To define KPIs centrally and have
them precalculated, we will use trend materializations.

We will take a common KPI called 'Success Rate' as an example and wrap it in a
materialization calculation.
